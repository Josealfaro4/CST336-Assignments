        Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, which is Earth's only natural satellite.
        Earth orbits around the Sun in 365.256 days, a period known as an Earth sidereal year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 365.256 times.
